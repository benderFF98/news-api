# Project Description

This is a small project of mine that was originally designed as an API-only project. However, I have added some Livewire components to make it easier to demonstrate the results.

## About the API

This API allows you to display and create articles that are indexed on other web pages. You have the option to create your own articles, making them accessible to users of this API by redirecting them to the corresponding page. Alternatively, you can consume articles collected by a Python script in another repository.

## Testing

To test the project, you can use Laravel Sail. First, set up the environment variables by copying the example file and then run the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail up
```
Once the containers are up and running, you can access a table of contents on the main page. To explore the API documentation, visit ```localhost/docs/api```.

### Creating a user
After everything is setup, you can go ahead and follow the api documentation to create a user for youserlf, and then issuing an API token so you can test the API.

## Automated Article Gathering
If you are interested in the automated process of gathering articles, you can clone the <a href='https://github.com/benderFF98/news-webcrawler'>Python repository<a> and run the corresponding script.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
